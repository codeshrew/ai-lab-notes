AI Lab Notes is a personal technical blog covering AI experimentation, coding, and system administration. The content is authored from a Pop!_OS workstation (Alienware Aurora R12, RTX 3090 24GB, 64GB RAM) used primarily for local AI/ML work.

## What You Will Find Here

- **AI experimentation**: Local LLM inference, model comparisons, RAG pipelines, and agentic workflows
- **Coding guides**: Python, TypeScript, CLI tools, and development environment setup
- **System administration**: Linux configuration, GPU stack management, Docker, and infrastructure
- **Research notes**: Short TIL entries, tool evaluations, and technical deep dives
